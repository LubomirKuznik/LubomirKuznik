Hi,

My name is Lubomir Kuznik.

I started coding last month, and now I'm learning GitHub along the way.  
Programming and GitHub are fantastic, and I should have started a long time ago.

Better late than never! :)  

What have I learned thus far?
- [x] GitHub - is set up. Starting to deep dive into HTML, CSS.
- [ ] Next steps - js, codespaces, Docker, Python, Flask
