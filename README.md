Hi,

My name is Lubomir Kuznik.

I started coding in October 2025 and have been learning GitHub along the way.
Programming and GitHub are fantastic, and I wish I had started a long time ago.

Better late than never! :)<br><br>

**What have I learned thus far?**

- [ ] Next steps - Deep dive into HTML and CSS.
- [ ] Next steps - JS, GitHub Codespaces, Docker, Python, Flask
